\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In our presentation, we will explore how user registration and login functionality can be implemented in a modern frontend application. We will explain the creation of controlled input forms, the execution of client-side validation, and the establishment of secure communication with a backend API using HTTP requests. Our focus will be on practical aspects such as managing forms, displaying validation errors, handling server error messages, and storing authentication status in the browser using sessions. For technologies, we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the React framework. The goal of our presentation is to provide an understanding of the typical authentication flow and best practices in real-world frontend development.
