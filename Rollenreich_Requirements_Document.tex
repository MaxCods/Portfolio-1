\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
Beyond the specific features, the application must meet the following quality attributes:

\subsection{Usability}
The webshop must be intuitive and easy to navigate. Key information (products, prices, cart) should be easily accessible. The checkout process must be clear and straightforward. Consistency in design and interaction patterns across the application is required.

\subsection{Responsiveness}
The application must be fully responsive and provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Layouts should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and orientations.

\subsection{Accessibility}
The webshop should strive to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines. This includes providing text alternatives for non-text content, ensuring keyboard navigability, sufficient color contrast, and compatibility with common assistive technologies.

\subsection{Performance}
The application should load quickly, typically within 3 seconds on a standard connection. Interactions (e.g., adding to cart, filtering products) should feel instantaneous. Backend response times should be optimized, and frontend assets (images, scripts) should be efficiently managed.

\subsection{Security}
User data (personal information, payment details) must be handled securely. Input validation must be implemented on both frontend and backend. Secure practices for authentication, session management, and data transmission (HTTPS) are mandatory.

\section{Technology Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend Framework:} The frontend will be developed using the React framework, as required by the course.
    \item \textbf{State Management:} A suitable state management library (e.g., Context API, Redux, Zustand) will be used for managing application state.
    \item \textbf{Styling:} CSS Modules, Styled Components, or a UI library like Material UI or Tailwind CSS might be used for styling.
    \item \textbf{Backend Interaction:} Communication with the backend will primarily use REST APIs with JSON as the data format.
    \item \textbf{Backend Technology:} The backend system (potentially developed in the Backend Systems course) could be based on Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask, Java/Spring, or another suitable technology capable of providing the required API endpoints. Alternatively, a public API could be integrated if appropriate for the project scope.
    \item \textbf{Version Control:} Git will be used for version control, likely hosted on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Timeline:} The project must be completed within the timeframe specified by the Frontend Systems course, including the final submission deadline (2025-04-30).
    \item \textbf{Team Size:} The development team consists of 4 students. Workload distribution and collaboration are key constraints.
    \item \textbf{Scope Limitation:} Due to time constraints, not all "Nice-to-have" features may be fully implemented. Priority will be given to "Must-have" features and core functionality.
    \item \textbf{Resource Availability:} The project relies on the availability and stability of the chosen backend API (whether custom-built or public).
    \item \textbf{Technology Stack:} The mandatory use of React for the frontend dictates certain architectural choices and development practices.
\end{itemize}
